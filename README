important files:
lab4.md     markdown source file
lab4.pdf    Lab4 report, generated by Mou
lab4.html   Same report, better rendering effects on Chrome
*.png       Lab4 screenshot

Note from lab3:
1. if `make` fails, try to `make` again will solve the problem.
2. strange things happens when I run `make grade` on OSX. I've verified
   my output by hand.
3. Github's markdown syntax is slightly different from my markdown editor.
   Please see lab*.html for better effects.
